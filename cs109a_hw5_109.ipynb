    "High dimensional problems can lead to problematic behavior in model estimation (and make prediction on a test set worse), thus we often want to try to reduce the dimensionality of our problems. A reasonable approach to reduce the dimensionality of the data is to use PCA and fit a logistic regression model on the smallest set of principal components that explain at least 90% of the variance in the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.1:** Fit two separate Logistic Regression models using principal components as the predictors: (1) with the number of components you selected from problem 1.5 and (2) with the number of components that explain at least 90% of the variability in the feature set. How do the classification accuracy values on both the training and tests sets compare with the models fit in question 3?   \n",
    "\n",
    "**4.2:** Use the code provided in question 3 (or your choice of visualization) to visualize the probabilities predicted by the fitted models in the previous part on both the training and test sets. How does the spread of probabilities in these plots compare to those for the model in question 3.2? If the lower dimensional representation yields comparable predictive power, what advantage does the lower dimensional representation provide?\n"
