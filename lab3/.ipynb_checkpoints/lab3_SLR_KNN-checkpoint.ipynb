Most of the major concepts in machine learning can be and often are discussed in terms of various linear regression models. Thus, this section will introduce you to building and fitting linear regression models and some of the process behind it, so that you can 1) fit models to data you encounter 2) experiment with different kinds of linear regression and observe their effects 3) see some of the technology that makes regression models work.\n",
