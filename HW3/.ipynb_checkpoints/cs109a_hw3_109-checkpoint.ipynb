Your task is to prepare a short report summarizing your findings and make recommendations.\n",

It costs the program money if bike stations are full and bikes cannot be returned, or empty and there are no bikes available. You will use multiple linear regression and polynomial regression and will explore techniques for subset selection to predict bike usage. The goal is to build a regression model that can predict the total number of bike rentals in a given hour of the day, based on all available information given to you. \n",
