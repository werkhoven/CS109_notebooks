    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Working with `Python`:  Functions,  Modules, and Libraries\n",
    "In the first part of this lab, you will brush up on your `python` skills.  You are assumed to have a basic, working knowledge of `python`.  We will go a little beyond this and begin to introduce and use some more interesting `python` features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments on `Python` Style\n",
    " - The Python style guide (how many spaces between = signs, how are function names capitalized?) is avilable here: [**PEP8**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This is the official style guide for this class.\n",
    " - In particular, you are expected to organize your code into functions, and document them via function annotations.\n",
    " - For the exact specification refer to [PEP307](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/).  \n",
    " \n",
    "Here is the basic format for writing annotated functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(name: str, age: int, weight, height: float = 150.0) -> list:\n",
    "    \"\"\"short description of the function's effect\n",
    "    description of input 1\n",
    "    decription of input 2\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    decription of output\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    code\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return [body_mass_index, disease_chance]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Things to notice:\n",
    "1. The argument list to the function contains information about the types.  For example, we can see explicitly that `name` is a `string`.\n",
    "2. The argument list is followed by an arrow pointing to the return type.  In this case, we can see that the return type should be a `list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Functions\n",
    " - If you have not yet written functions as part of your coding education, you should strongly consider taking another coding class before this one. We assume familiarity with the mechanics of writing functions and the reasons to do so.\n",
    " - Python does not check the types of the variables at runtime. The documentation above is strictly for human readers; it's prefectly possible to pass a floating point value to the `name` input\n",
    " - Python supports default arguments. If a user calls `my_func('david', 30, 170)`, omitting the height argument, the code will run with height taking the default value of `150.0`.\n",
    " - Python functions can be called with named arguments. These can occur in any order. For instance `my_func(age=10, name='will', weight=120)` works as expected, even though the arguments are technically out of order\n",
    " - Python supports functions with variable numbers of arguments and variable numbers of key-word arguments. See [Defining Functions in `Python`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions) for more.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question:  Think of a few reasons why to use function annotations.\n",
    "##### Question:  Think of a case where it makes sense to have a default value for a particular function.  If you can't think of one yet, consider the default used by the 'join' function discussed later in this lab."

    "### Python Classes, Modules, and Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes/Objects\n",
    "In true object oriented programming (OOP), the developer writes code around things called objects.  An object (or a class) groups together data and functions that operate on that data.  You might know this terminology from *C++* and other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, maybe I have one function that calculates the area of a circle and another function that calculates the perimiter.  I could group these two functions together, along with data about the circle into a class called `circle`.\n",
    "A user can create a particular circle by *instantiating* a `circle` oject, as we do below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from shapes import circle\n",
    "my_circle = circle(r=5)\n",
    "circle_area = my_circle.area()\n",
    "circle_perimiter = my_circle.perimiter()\n",
    "```\n",
    "When a function is part of an object it is called a *method* instead of a function. Notice that methods are accessed using the *dot* notation.\n",
    "**What really matters for this class is that we will often create an object and use the methods associated with it without having to worry about the object's internal workings**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modules\n",
    "Modules in python contain a bunch of code that logically fits together. Most often this is a bunch of classes and functions that address a particular need. For example, there could be a `shapes.py` file that contains the `circle` class used above, as well as a `triangle` class and maybe even a `will_they_fit` function to tell if one shape can fit inside another. That .py file would then be called a module, and we could import from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only want particular portions of a module, we use the ___from___ ___ import ___ syntax above. If we want the whole module, we can do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import shapes\n",
    "my_circle = shapes.circle(r=5)\n",
    "my_triangle = shapes.triangle(3,4,5)\n",
    "circle_area = my_circle.area()\n",
    "fit_flag = shapes.will_they_fit(my_circle, my_triangle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries\n",
    "Libraries may contain a bunch of modules that go together.  A library usually has a specific directory structure.  We won't discuss these further here, becuase as a user you only need to know about the import syntax above."

    "\n",
    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "*Regular Expressions* (a.k.a. `regex` or `regexp`) are a tool for working with and manipulating text data.  We've already done some text manipulation in this lab.  We've shied away from particularly thorny examples until now.  Using `python`'s string methods is useful, but that approach has it's limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions provide a set of rules for working with text data.  At first, these expressions look completely foreign (e.g. `([0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+){3})`), but once you know some of the basics they're not so bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, the fundamentals of regular expressions are based upon abstract algebra.  Mathematicians have studied regular expressions simply to lay down and understand their theoretical underpinnings.  We won't go anywhere near that level of detail.  For us, regular expressions will simply be used to process some gnarly text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key `regex` patterns and concepts that you must know and be comfortable with.  That fact is, there are many ways to create a `regex` to search for a particular pattern.  Some approaches are more succinct than others.  As with most things, you will get better the more you practice.  You should try to make your `regex` patterns as crisp as possible while still mainting readabilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some resources\n",
    "In order to become proficient with `regex`s, you are **strongly encouraged** to take the *RegexOne* tutorial at [https://regexone.com/](https://regexone.com/).  That tutorial is an interactive and accessible introduction to regular expressions.  It contains problems at the end to test your knowledge.  The *RegexOne* website also contains a very nice demo for `Python3`.  This lab will borrow from the *RegexOne* `python` demo to walk you through some concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to consider the book [Mastering Regular Expressions](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528126.do) for more details as well as some historical comments.\n",
